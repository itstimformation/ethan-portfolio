  <h1>Hello!<br> <span>I'm Ethan</span></h1>

  <p class="brief"> Can you guess my name yet? I am currently a student at Ulster University studying
		 interaction design. <br />I am an illustrator enthusiast and an ever-improving code
		  dabbler that enjoys bringing ideas to life.</p>

		<p class="brief">When I am not in University or at home working, I have a group of friends that likes to go
				 on ‘adventures’ <br /> in wooded areas or places that we know we would get lost in…it’s no fun knowing
				  where you are going.</P>

					<p class="brief">	My plan for next year? I hope to have organised a placement with a design company
					 and do some <br />fantastic work with great people, while learning new skills on the way. You never know where it could take you.</P>

<p>
I am a frequent user of adobe suite and have used and learned the vast number of programmes they have available.
</p>


<h4>Illustration</h4>

<p>
	I commonly use adobe illustrator within my day to day actives, both university work and client work.
</p>



<h4>Web</h4>

<p>
	I have created multiple websites in the past from my teaching of html CSS and JS, thus allowing
	me to freely create websites how I want them to look and not feel limited within design.
	Everything is heading to the web and it is an important skill to have under my wing.
</p>

<h4>Print layout and design</h4>

<p>
	I have done print work such as flyers and leaflets for clients in the past with positive response
	 and feedback from viewers. I enjoy getting away from web design and putting my mind to print,
	 something about being able to physically see the finished piece of work is so satisfying.
</p>


<h4>Branding</h4>

<p>
	Being able to understand someone’s vision and create a brand around that vison is so important.
	 You see a lot of small business out there trying to brand themselves without really knowing
	  what they are looking for.  I have the skills to create and improve existing brands to make
		them be what they were fist imagined as.
